# Making an API

## Short notice

I have a lot of experiences in developing themes for Wordpress but I want to explore new fields. The last year I learned about Node.js and React.js and have seen the possibilities. It's time that I dive into these new technologies to improve my skills and become a professional developer. That being said, I came up with the idea to make an API based on the knowledge I gain by following the online course from [Mosh Hamedani](https://programmingwithmosh.com/) on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-master-class/). In this repo, you can read my process and the end result. In the [log](log.md) you can find what I did and when.
